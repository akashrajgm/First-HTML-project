    <p>In computer programming, a <b>software framework</b> is a software abstraction that provides generic functionality which developers can extend with custom code to create applications. It establishes a standard foundation for building and deploying software, offering reusable components and design patterns that handle common programming tasks within a larger software platform or environment.

        Unlike libraries where developers call functions as needed, frameworks implement inversion of control by dictating program structure and calling user code at specific points, while also providing default behaviors, structured extensibility mechanisms, and maintaining a fixed core that accepts extensions without direct modification. Frameworks also differ from regular applications that can be modified (like web browsers through extensions, video games through mods), in that frameworks are intentionally incomplete scaffolding meant to be extended through well-defined extension points and following specific architectural patterns.
        
        Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, toolsets, and APIs that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or system.
