    <p><b>The Spring Framework</b> is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform.[2] The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. The framework does not impose any specific programming model.[citation needed]. The framework has become popular in the Java community as an addition to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model.[3] The Spring Framework is free and open source software.
